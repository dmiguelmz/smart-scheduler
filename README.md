We designed and implemented a simplified version of a
Smart Scheduler that automates exam scheduling using
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. 

Features
Add new exams (exam name, date, time, and room)
View all scheduled exams
Edit any exam
Delete an exam
Stops you from adding exams at the same date and time 

What You Need
Python installed on your computer (version 3 or higher)
A code software editor like Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

How to Run It
1. Open the folder where the scheduler.py file is saved.
2. Open VS Code and open that folder.
3. Click on scheduler.py to open the file.
4. Press the Run button at the top, or
   Right-click anywhere in the file and choose "Run Python File".
5. A menu will appear in the terminal â€” you can now use the program.
